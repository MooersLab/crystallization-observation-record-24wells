# Scoresheet for crystallization drops and post-crystallization treatments

This scoresheet is for a four-row and six-column crystallization tray.
The instructions on using this score sheet are in its header.
We have used this version for three years. 
We consider it to be stable.
Please take a look at the related repository for the [scoring key](https://github.com/MooersLab/crystal-score-key) that we use.

You can record numerical scores regarding ranking the drops by their desirability.
You can also record the length of the longest crystal in each drop for those drops that have crystals large enough to be measured.
This crystal is most likely to be successfully harvested from the drop for fire protection, whereas the other crystals are more likely to be damaged during this harvesting process.

The PDF of the scoresheet is provided along with tex file that was used to generate it in LaTeX.
